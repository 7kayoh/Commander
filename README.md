Commander with Latte Framework

## Project goal

This project is to enchance our current UI with Latte, so it will be extremely flexible and modular to use, as well as being much customizable without compromising the game's size.

The current average theme size is around 1-2mb, but with Latte, this will be reduced into kilobytes, or even smaller.

## Installation

To install this beta build, you need to use Rojo with Git, please install those two if you haven't. After that, you can use the following commands in your terminal.
```
git clone -b Latte https://github.com/va1kio/commander.git && cd commander && rojo serve
```
